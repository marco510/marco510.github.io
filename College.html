        <h2> Majors</h2>
        <P>A major I like from Duke would be biophysics. I think 
        that learning more about animals and plants and how they might be effected
        by physics would be interesting

           One major that really intrested me in UC Berkeley was Biology.
           This really interested me because I would like to pursue something where
           I can study life and and animals.
