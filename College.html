          <h1>College Pathway</h1>
           <center></center><p>I currently have a 2.2 gpa so I might not get into some of the higher colleges but If I work hard enough I might. most of the time I am a B student so I can enter colleges with a 3.0 average acceptance gpa. I picked these three colleges because they all simmed interesting. Most of the college I chose also have biology majors which is something I would like to study</p>
        <h1>Duke </h1>

        <h2> Requirments</h2>        
        <ul>
            <li>GPA: 4.17</li>
            <li>ACT Scores:31-34</li>
            <li>SAT Scores:2130</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Majors</h2>
        <P>A major I like from Duke would be biophysics. I think 
        that learning more about animals and plants and how they might be effected
        by physics would be interesting. Duke is also one of the best schools for biology and learing from one of the best schools for biology would really help me.
        </P>
<h2> Student Life</h2> 
        <p>Duke has co-ed dorms and students are reqired to live in the dorms for the first three years. The majority of students at duke are white with the secound biggest group being asians. I also found that 71% of the staff is white. This is important to me because I have never been in the minority in other schools so this would be a new experience. Duke is also a well known sports school with nba players such as kyrie irving and J.J redick.</p>

          <h2>Majors</h2>
          <p>
           One major that really intrested me in CSU East bay was Biology.
           This really interested me because I would like to pursue something where
           I can study life and and animals. It is also very close so I can drive there and back.
          </p>
          <h2>Student Life</h2>
          <p>
            CSU East Bay is a very diverse college with most of the students being latino followed by asians.It is also a co-ed school whith the majority of the college being female. I also found out that it is ncaa division 2 college school but sports is not a big part of the school.

            Most students at UC davis live on campus with only a few living with family. davis has a majority of asian students with white being the 2nd biggest group. The majority of the students are also female with 59% of the school. I also found that many people in the college bike to classes and Uc davis has alot of accommodations for those who do.
