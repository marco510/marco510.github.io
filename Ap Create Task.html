             The kinect is a new motion controlled device that lets you use your body as a controller created by microsoft for the Xbox One 2).One benefit about the kinect is the ability to give an activity that does not require you to move some movement. By giving people the ability to play just by moving to an activity that is growing rapidly it makes people a lot more healthy because they are not just sitting for hours. But while this is beneficial in terms of health it is not good for privacy because that is one harm the kinect is a type of camera. When the new Xbox one came out it was said that you needed two things to stay connected at all times the internet and the kinect. Many people thought this was very weird and were outraged since the kinect came out as an accessory not as a main feature in the xbox 360. But since the kinect is a camera that tracks movement and uses that data to tell the system what you are doing many people began to wonder if the reason they needed the kinect and wifi was in order for them to spy on you.

             The kinect is a camera that tracks movement and uses that movement as data. That data is used to make sure what you are doing is what the character is doing it transfers your movement into the character you play as. But as I said it tracks movement so it also tracks you, since this is true if that data is either hacked or already being used by the company it means strangers can see you even in your own home. This will affect society because we will get used to losing all of our privacy. With more and more devices with cameras it is now common to see them wherever you go and now there might be a company's camera even in your own home. I think that if we continue to buy and support things like this the more we will be used to them to a point where privacy just became a thing of the past.

             The purpose of block code is to make it snow on the canvas or make white dots. When block runs correctly, it makes white dots go down from the top of the canvas. The algorithm is able to achieve this result by first deciding the number of ellipsis then coloring them with fill using rgb. If this program did not include algorithm , it would not make any ellipsis and it would just leave the picture of the mountain.
This algorithm works with random and X position to make the white dots appear randomly and go down the screen and uses bgYSpeed to control how fast they fall and bgYPos to decide where they are made.

            An example of an abstraction in my program is draw mountain. This simplifies my code because it lets the whole mountain be moved and drawn without using many arrays.
I created this function to avoid repeating array to create the image. If this abstraction werenâ€™t present, then I would have needed many more arrays.
