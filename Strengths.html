        <h3>Competing</h3>
        <P>You see many things in life as a game, and you feel great joy when 
        you win. You truly hate to lose because you are always striving for 
        first place. Every day you compete. Winning first place is your goal in 
        any contest that you feel is worth your time. If there is no one to 
        compete against, you compete against yourself to do more or accomplish a
        goal faster or better. You can be competing against someone else even 
        when that person doesn't know it. Because you hate to lose, you might 
        get angry, upset, or even cry. It does not matter if others think the 
        contest is important. If you are doing it, you want to be number one. 
        Others look to you for the motivation to win.</P>

        <h3>Dependability</h3>
        <P>
         Trust is important to you, and you care about being seen as responsible and trustworthy.
         People count on you to do what you say you will do. When you make a promise, you mean to keep it. 
         You like being chosen to be in charge of getting something done because you know it means others see you as dependable and trustworthy. 
         Sometimes, being asked to do more is like getting a reward because it means people believe in you. 
         Maybe you have special chores or responsibilities at home or at school. 
         Whatever job you are given, you want to get it done. Some people might say you act older than other kids your age because you are so responsible. 
         You can be a good example to other people. Earning the praise of teachers and parents for getting things done and doing what is right feels good to you. 
         People count on you to do what you say you will do.
        </P>

        <h3>Future Thinking</h3>
        <P>Your mind loves to think and dream about the future. You are a person who thinks about what is possible, not what is impossible.
        You like to imagine the life you will have, what new things will be invented, and what you will be able to do that you cannot do now. 
        What kind of person will you be? How will the world be different in 10 years or 100 years? What are your dreams? Your visions of the future might be bigger than most people's because thinking big is one of your talents.
        You like to think about the important things in life, what they mean, and how they are connected to each other. 
        Finding meaning is important to you. It is not enough for you to simply concentrate on what you need to do today because your mind needs more adventure than that. You spend time thinking about ideas, not just facts.
        Thinking big paints pictures of what the future can be.
        </P>
