        <h3>Competing</h3>
        <P>One of my strengths is competing which means I try to beat others when competing in something. It also means that I don't like to lose so I always try my hardest to win. People who are competing are also hard working since they want to make sure they don't lose. I also think that competing also means that you always want to be challenged since If you aren't it is boring.</P>
        <P>One way I see this strength is when I play basketball or race . My strength of  competing is mostly shown here because I have a lot of confidence in these activities so I don't like to lose on these activities. I think this is also shown in school whenever I am confident in a subject I try to be the best at it. I think that whenever I am interested in something and I can compare myself to others that really motivates me.</P>
